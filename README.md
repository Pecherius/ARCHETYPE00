# ARCHETYPE_00 // Corrupted Fragment

> *"In the ethereal network, fragments resonate with the collective will of their holders. Each corrupted piece amplifies the signal of those who dare to hold them."*

## Fragment Status: **ACTIVE**

The ARCHETYPE_00 fragment has been successfully integrated into the Punkable Ethereal System. The resonance field is now operational, responding to holder density and creating spontaneous network events.

### System Capabilities

- **Resonance Detection**: The fragment now responds to holder frequency patterns
- **Ethereal Integration**: Seamless connection with LUKSO's Universal Profile infrastructure  
- **Quantum Selection**: Advanced algorithms that respond to fragment density
- **Network Anomalies**: Spontaneous events triggered by collective resonance

### Technical Specifications

- **Framework**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom cyberpunk aesthetics
- **Storage**: LocalStorage with persistent data management
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for fluid interactions
- **Languages**: Multi-language support (ES/EN)

### Fragment Behavior

The ARCHETYPE_00 fragment operates on principles of distributed resonance. Each holder becomes a node in the ethereal network, their signal strength determined by fragment density. The system responds to collective action rather than individual authority.

**Warning**: This fragment contains corrupted data from damaged chain archives. Its internal structure is unstable and may cause unexpected network reactions. Each interaction increases the probability of spontaneous events across the Punkable Ethereal System.

### Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Fragment Manifesto

*"We are the architects of our own digital reality. Each fragment we hold amplifies our signal in the ethereal network. The more fragments we accumulate, the stronger our collective resonance becomes."*

*"The network decides how to react, but our signal strength determines our influence. We are not users—we are nodes. We are not consumers—we are creators of frequency."*
